# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Data Structure
A data structure is a way of organizing and 
storing data in a way that the data can be manipulated
efficiently. Some examples of data structure
include List, Array, Queue, Stack etc.

### Basic Operations of Data Structures
1. **Insert** - to insert a new item.
2. **Update** - update existing item.
3. **Sort** - sort items in the data structure.
4. **Search** - find an item.
5. **Delete** - delete an item from the data structure.

#### Stack
Stack is a data structure that only allows
operations at the last data inserted. Stack
uses the LIFO (Last in First Out) mechanism
to push and pop from the stack. These are the basic
operations of a stack:

1. **Pop** - remove item at the top of the stack
2. **Push** - push new item on top of stack.
3. **Peek** - get the top element of the stack.

#### Queue
Queue is a data structure that uses the FIFO (First in First Out)
principle to remove and insert new items. Queues are similar to
Stacks - the difference is stacks uses LIFO while queues uses 
FIFO principle.These are the basic operations of a queue:

1. **Insert / Enqueue** - add item from the rear of the queue.
2. **Remove / Dequeue** - remove an item from the front of the queue.
3. **Peek** - get element at the front of the queue.

An algorithm in simple words is a step-by-step 
solution to a problem. Examples of algorithms include
Search, Sort etc.

## Big O Notation
Big O notation is a way of analyzing the time it takes 
an algorithm to perform a task as well as the space (memory)
it takes to perform a task.
1. **Constant O(1)**
2. **Logarithmic O(log n)**
3. **Quadratic O(n2)**
4. **Exponential O(2n)**
