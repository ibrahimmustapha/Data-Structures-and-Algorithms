## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Data Structure
A data structure is a way of organizing and 
storing data in a way that the data can be manipulated
efficiently. Some examples of data structure
include List, Array, Queue, Stack etc.

#### Basic Operations of Data Structures
1. Insert - to insert a new item.
2. Update - update existing item.
3. Sort - sort items in the data structure.
4. Search - find an item.
5. Delete - delete an item from the data structure.

### Algorithm
An algorithm in simple words is a step-by-step 
solution to a problem. Examples of algorithms include
Search, Sort etc.

## Big O Notation
Big O notation is a way of analyzing the time it takes 
an algorithm to perform a task as well as the space (memory)
it takes to perform a task.
1. Constant O(1)
2. Logarithmic O(log n)
3. Linear O(n)
4. Quadratic O(n2)
5. Exponential O(2n)
